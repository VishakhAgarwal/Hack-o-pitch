**PROBLEM STATEMNET:** 

Data Centers consume 2%-3% of global electricity. With increased prominence of generative AI, Cloud and IOT-based services, data center energy consumption is forecasted to skyrocket to 5% of global electricity consumption. Traditional data center cooling consumes an equally high amount of energy as the data center hardware and computation. Hence, the **need is to optimally and securely cool data center to prevent over-cooling of the facilities and reduce costs and carbon footprints.** 

**OUR SOLUTION:**

We have developed an **innovative interoperable Blockchain-based system **that revolutionizes the traditional static cooling systems in data centers and **saves the energy wasted in overcooling of the facility by almost 15% to 55%.** This we do by **implementing a precision-based smart dynamic cooling system** that cools a specific region of influence based on the workload and other data center attributes. This groundbreaking solution aims to **save power, reduce costs and promote sustainability.** 

**Energy Tracking and Management:** Web3 enables the implementation of **cross-chain based energy tracking systems in data centers.** By recording energy consumption and production data on a transparent and immutable ledger, stakeholders can monitor and manage energy usage more efficiently. Smart contracts can be used to automate energy management processes and enable dynamic adjustments based on demand and availability.

**Incentivized Energy Conservation:** Web3 platforms can **introduce cross-chain token-based incentive mechanisms to encourage energy-efficient practices in data centers.** For instance, data center operators can be rewarded with tokens for adopting energy-saving measures, optimizing cooling systems, and reducing carbon emissions. These tokens can be traded, staked, or used for other purposes within the web3 ecosystem.

**OUR APPROACH:** 

By harnessing the power of **predictive analytics, AI-ML, decentralized governance, and blockchain technology**, our system empowers data centers to make informed energy management decisions, leading to significant power savings. This not only contributes to environmental preservation but also fosters a culture of trust and transparency within the industry.

Our system operates through a **smart contract**, which securely stores real-time data-center variables like temperature, server power consumtion, humidity, facility airflow, etc obtained using sensors like AHT20. These variables are then fed into our analysis software that uses **sophisticated Machine learning algorithms for real-time cooling requirement prediction and workload-trend prediction for various regions of influence / Data Center thermal areas (DCTA).** By leveraging this smart dynamic cooling technology, data centers can significantly optimize their energy usage , reduce costs and carbon footprints. 

To ensure trust and transparency, any company or industry wishing to utilize our system must undergo a **decentralized Know Your Customer (De KYC)** process. This mechanism employs a multisignature approach, requiring approval from both the industry and our team. Once approved, the industry gains access to our platform and becomes a member, unlocking various benefits and rewards.

**We offer three membership tiers: Silver, Gold, and Platinum.** Each membership tier provides additional advantages and incentives to the industry. Membership is facilitated through SBTs (Smart Contract-Based Tokens), which are unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These tokens cannot be transferred to another person, ensuring the integrity of membership ownership.**This NFT's are made CrossChain using Router Protocol.**

After using our system for 30 days, a member attains Silver membership status and becomes eligible to claim associated rewards and allowances. Similarly, Gold membership unlocks after 90 days, and Platinum membership unlocks after 365 days. Each membership level comes with its own set of exclusive benefits, reflecting the member's commitment to sustainable energy practices.**All these rewards and membership NFT's can be recieved on any chain using Router Crosstalk library.**

To enhance security and scalability, our smart contract is deployed on the Polygon network, providing fast and cost-effective transactions. Furthermore, metadata for the Membership NFTs is stored on IPFS, a decentralized storage platform, ensuring the integrity and accessibility of membership data.

**These NFT's are made CrossChain using Router Protocol's CrossTalk Library enabling user to get the membership irrespective of their preferred Chains**
